# NTWIST Full Stack Developer Assessment
Hello and welcome to my submission for the Full Stack Developer role at NTWIST.

# About the Assignment
As part of the selection process, I was tasked with recreating two homepages:

ntwist.com
github.com
Both of these were to be built using React.js and the codebase had to be fully commented for clarity.

# Technologies Used
React.js: For building the UI components.
CSS: For styling the components.

# How to Run Locally
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/dhwanil95/ntwist-assessment

Navigate to the directory:
cd ntwist-assessment

Navigate to the ntwist hone page:
cd ntwist-clone

Navigate to the github hone page:
cd github-clone

Install the dependencies:
npm install

Start the application:
npm start

This will launch the application on localhost:3000 or another available port. Open a browser and navigate to the address to view the app.
